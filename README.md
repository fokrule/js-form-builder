# Dynamic Form Builder

## Overview
The Dynamic Form Builder is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom forms with ease. Whether you need a simple contact form or a complex survey, this project lets you design forms that fit your needs perfectly. You can create forms with various field types, customize placeholders, and export the forms for use in any web project.

## Supported Form Types
You can add the following types of fields to your form:
- **Text Field**
- **Textarea**
- **Number**
- **Email**
- **Select Dropdown**
- **Checkbox**
- **Radio Buttons**
- **Date Picker**

## How It Works
1. **Select Form Elements:** Start by choosing the form elements you need from the supported list.
2. **Customize Fields:** For each selected element, you can add a name and a placeholder to define the purpose of the field.
3. **Save Your Form:** Once youâ€™ve added all your fields, click the **Save** button to generate the form, which will then appear in the **View** section.
4. **Export Your Form:** After completing your form design, you can export the HTML code and embed it into any web page or project.
5. **Database Integration:** This library is designed to allow form data to be saved to a database, enabling you to load and manage dynamic forms directly from your database.

## Future Enhancements
- **Field Reordering:** Implementing arrow buttons and drag-and-drop functionality to rearrange form fields easily.
- **Save All Button:** Adding a **Save All** button to simplify the saving process, allowing you to save all fields at once instead of individually.
- **Detailed Instructions:** Providing comprehensive documentation to guide users on how to use the application effectively.


## Conclusion
The Dynamic Form Builder is a flexible and easy-to-use tool for anyone needing custom forms. With future enhancements and additional features, this project will continue to evolve, providing even greater functionality and user experience.
